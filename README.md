1.find_elements.cpp
Design an element finding algorithm (backward and forward). If the element is found, then return the position of the element in the array, otherwise return 0.

2.LinkList
Given an unordered single-linked table L consisting of positive integers (with a header node), write an algorithm to accomplish the following functions.
(1) Print all the elements of the single-linked table.
(2) Find the length of the single-linked table.
(3) Find the maximum node and print the value.
(4) Move this maximum node to the top of the chain table.

3.array_sum
Given an array of integers A[n], design a recursive algorithm to find the sum of the elements of the array.

4. branket_pairs
Suppose three kinds of brackets may appear in an arithmetic expression: round brackets "(" and ")", square brackets "[" and "] " and the brackets "{" and "}", and these three brackets can be used in any order of nesting. Write an algorithm to determine whether the brackets contained in a given expression occur in pairs.

5.sort
Given an array of integers A[n], implement a simple selection sorting algorithm.
Example: Perform a simple selection sort on the array A[6]={12, 3, 15, 7, 2, 8}.
Initial state: 12,3,15,7,2,8
1st result: 2,3,15,7,12,8
2nd trip result: 2,3,15,7,12,8
The 3rd result: 2,3,7,15,12,8
The 4th result: 2,3,7,8,12,15
The 5th result: 2,3,7,8,12,15
The 6th result: 2,3,7,8,12,15
